# Snowflake-Powered-Purchase-Analytics-and-Weather-Insights
The project involves a comprehensive approach to extracting, loading, and transforming data using Python and Snowflake. It starts with automating the PUT process using Python to upload 41 CSV files containing monthly purchase order data into Snowflake, emphasizing the use of COPY INTO for efficiency. The project then constructs a calculated field for purchase order totals, integrating line item data to form a POAmount field. Next, supplier invoice data in XML format is shredded into a table format. These datasets are joined to analyze differences between invoiced and quoted amounts, resulting in a materialized view or table named 'purchase_orders_and_invoices'.

Subsequently, the project extracts supplier data from a PostgreSQL database, employing Python for data movement without intermediate import into Python itself. The data is transferred directly to Snowflake. Additionally, weather data is integrated from the Snowflake Marketplace, focusing on unique zip codes in the supplier data. A materialized view, 'supplier_zip_code_weather', is created, encompassing zip codes, dates, and high temperatures. Finally, the project links purchase orders, supplier information, and weather data based on zip codes and transaction dates, aligning transactions with corresponding temperature readings.
